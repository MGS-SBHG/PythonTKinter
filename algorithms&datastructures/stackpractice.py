"""Add a couple methods to our LinkedList class,
and use that to implement a Stack.
You have 4 functions below to fill in:
insert_first, delete_first, push, and pop.
Think about this while you're implementing:
why is it easier to add an "insert_first"
function than just use "append"?

Solution:
We had two options hereâ€”
either pop and push from the first element in our linked list, 
or pop and push from the last element. 
We already had a function, append(), that adds an element to the end.

Why didn't we just come up with a function for removing the last element 
and call it a day? 
Every operation on a linked list must start with the head. append() 
thus traverses the whole list, taking O(n). 
Any operation on the last element requires us to traverse everything, 
so even though we had to write a new method our code will run much faster 
if we push/pop from the first element in a linked list.
